Hi [Name],
Good morning! Hope youâ€™re doing well.

Iâ€™m Anil Kumar Karri, a Python Backend Intern at Algonox Technologies, Hyderabad, currently working on a large-scale SIM Management Platform (AMOP) using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

I developed projects like AI-Powered YouTube Notes Generator, a web app that summarizes YouTube videos and translates them using Google APIs. I also built an HR Helper Bot that retrieves employee data using NLP queries, and a Cataract Diagnosis System that leverages ML for medical predictions. These projects reflect my ability to apply Python, Flask, and ML/NLP to build scalable and impactful solutions.

I believe an entry-level backend or AI developer role at your organization would be a great opportunity to learn and contribute meaningfully. I would be truly grateful if you could refer me for any suitable opportunities or guide me on how to proceed further.

Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Anil Kumar Karri
